## Overview

Batsquatch is a cryptid reported near Mount St. Helens, Washington in 1994. Described as a nine-foot tall humanoid with blue fur, yellow eyes, a wolf-like muzzle, and large bat-like wings, the creature allegedly flew past a vehicle driven by Brian Canfield shortly after volcanic activity.

The creature represents a combination of traditional Bigfoot characteristics with the added feature of wings, similar to other winged humanoid cryptids like Mothman. Despite the dramatic sighting, Batsquatch remains a one-time report with no subsequent confirmations.

## Notable Sightings

### Brian Canfield Sighting (1994) ⭐

> **Date**: 1994
> **Location**: Near Mount St. Helens, Washington
> **Witnesses**: 1 (Brian Canfield)
> **Evidence**: Witness testimony only

Brian Canfield was driving near Mount St. Helens following a volcanic eruption when he reportedly observed a large, blue-furred, winged creature fly past his vehicle. The creature was described as approximately 9 feet tall with yellow eyes, a wolf-like muzzle, and large bat-like wings.

**Credibility Assessment**: Low — Single witness, no physical evidence, no subsequent sightings, unusual blue coloration inconsistent with known animals. Timing with volcanic activity suggests possible misidentification of debris or atmospheric phenomena.

## Evidence

### Physical Evidence
None documented.

### Photographic/Video Evidence
None documented.

### Audio Evidence
None documented.

## Theories & Explanations

### Cryptozoological Theories

1. **Volcanic Mutation (Satirical)**
   A tongue-in-cheek theory that volcanic activity somehow mutated a Bigfoot specimen. Not taken seriously by researchers.

2. **Genuine Unknown Creature**
   Possibility of an undocumented winged cryptid in the Mount St. Helens area.

### Skeptical Explanations

1. **Misidentified Large Bird**
   Witness misidentified a large bird (eagle, condor) in post-eruption atmospheric conditions with poor visibility.

2. **Volcanic Debris**
   Volcanic debris or atmospheric phenomena misinterpreted in stressful post-eruption conditions.

3. **Hoax**
   Fabricated story for attention or entertainment. Single witness with no corroborating evidence.

---

## Cultural Significance

### Popular Culture

Batsquatch has entered Pacific Northwest cryptid folklore as a curiosity, occasionally discussed in cryptozoology circles and internet forums. The creature lacks the cultural depth of traditional Bigfoot or other established cryptids.

**Notable Mentions**:
- Local Pacific Northwest cryptid discussions
- Internet cryptozoology forums
- Regional folklore collections

---

## Research & Investigation

### Current Status

No active research programs. The single 1994 sighting has not been followed up with subsequent reports or investigations.

### Research Notes

The lack of follow-up sightings, absence of physical evidence, and unusual characteristics (especially the blue coloration) make Batsquatch one of the more dubious cryptid reports. Most researchers consider it either a misidentification or fabrication.
