      "full": "Batsquatch is a cryptid reported near Mount St. Helens, Washington in 1994. Described as a nine-foot tall humanoid with blue fur, yellow eyes, a wolf-like muzzle, and large bat-like wings, the creature allegedly flew past a vehicle driven by Brian Canfield shortly after volcanic activity. The creature represents a combination of traditional Bigfoot characteristics with the added feature of wings, similar to other winged humanoid cryptids. Despite the dramatic sighting, Batsquatch remains a one-time report with no subsequent confirmations."
